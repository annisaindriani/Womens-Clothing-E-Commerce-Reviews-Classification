# Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews Classification
## Description
This project aims to classify reviews of women's clothing in an e-commerce context using Python. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 23,486 rows and 11 columns, representing five distinct classes of reviews. The analysis employs various classification methods, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.

To enhance model performance, the project also incorporates ensemble methods such as voting, bagging, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting for hyperparameter tuning. This comprehensive approach not only aims to achieve accurate classification results but also provides valuable insights into customer sentiments, serving as a useful resource for data scientists and e-commerce analysts.
